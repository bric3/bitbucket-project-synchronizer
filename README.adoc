= Bitbucket project synchronizer

This utility allows to either `git clone` or `git pull --rebase --prune` repositories inside a
bitbucket _project_.

== Usage

[source,sh]
----
âžœ ./bitb-project-sync --help
Usage of ./bitb-project-sync:
  -dry-run
        Perform dry run
  -from-file string
        A json document matching the repos Bitbucket REST api, incompatible with --project-url
  -project-dir string
        The path of the project directory, if none specified, use current working directory (default "<current dir>")
  -project-url string
        The bitbucket url, incompatible with --from-file
  -token-file string
        The path of the readToken file, only used when HTTP request is made
  -verbose
        Log verbosely (default true)
----

This tool will extract which git repositories of a bitbucket project to synchronize. This tool assumes that

 * the current working directory is the project root and that sub-directories of this folder matches the name of the
   project's repositories.
 * repositories name have the same folder name locally


=== from the api

Those repositories are found using either the Bitbucket API directly
https://docs.atlassian.com/bitbucket-server/rest/5.7.0/bitbucket-rest.html#idm45568365953232[``GET /rest/api/1.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos``]
and read the document listing all git repositories.


[source,sh]
----
./bitb-project-sync --project-url https://authority/rest/api/1.0/projects/services/repos?limit=1
----

At this time the tool doesn't handle pagination, so the URI should be crafted to fetch all repositories.

If the project is not public, then you can authenticate via an authorization token that can be
https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/personal-access-tokens-939515499.html[created from your bitbucket account].

In this case store the token in a file, then configure the tool to use it :

[source,sh]
----
./bitb-project-sync \
    --token-file ./path/to/the/token-file
    --project-url https://authority/rest/api/1.0/projects/services/repos?limit=1
----


=== from a local json file

This mode will read a local json document, this document is assumed to be the same document as the one returned by
the Bitbucket REST API https://docs.atlassian.com/bitbucket-server/rest/5.7.0/bitbucket-rest.html#idm45568365953232[``GET /rest/api/1.0/projects/{projectKey}/repos``]

[source,sh]
----
./bitb-project-sync --from-file project-repository.json
----


== Build it

Simply do

[source,sh]
----
go build bitb-project-sync.go
----

== A word about code quality

This project has been started as a pet project to learn a bit about Go lang. This has been done in a matter of hours,
but the code itself may not be of great quality as I don't grasp the Go lang idioms at this time.
Also note there's no unit test. This a room for improvement that is for later.
